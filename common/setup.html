                      If you're new to this site, then this should be the first thing you do.  You can't do any of the projects unless you set up your environment first.
                      I have tried to make it as easy as possible for you to get up and running.  You just need to follow the steps below and you should be good to go.
                      Make sure you run the test program at the end and that it compiles successfully before moving on to any of the projects.
                  </p>

                      <p>
                          The first thing you want to do is create your project folder structure.  It's actually not that complicated, just pick a location on your
                          computer where you want to store the project.  Create a new folder and name it something descriptive.  My folder here is called ProjectName.
                          That's not very descriptive so choose a better name depending on what project you're working on.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                          Go into the folder you just created and create 2 more folders called 'include' and 'source'.  The source folder will hold all of our C++ (.cpp) files
                          and the include folder will hold all of our header (.h) files.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                          You also want to include the Makefile which can be found in your devkitpro folder structure at devkitpro/examples/gba/template folder.
                          Just copy that Makefile into your project folder.
                      </p>

                          computer where you want to store the project.  Create a new folder and name it something descriptive.  My folder here is called ProjectName.
                          That's not very descriptive so choose a better name depending on what project you're working on.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                          Go into the folder you just created and create 2 more folders called 'include' and 'source'.  The source folder will hold all of our C++ (.cpp) files
                          and the include folder will hold all of our header (.h) files.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                          You also want to include the Makefile which can be found in your devkitpro folder structure at devkitpro/examples/gba/template folder.
                          Just copy that Makefile into your project folder.
                      </p>

                          The first thing you want to do is create your project folder structure.  It's actually not that complicated, just pick a location on your
                          computer where you want to store the project.  Create a new folder and name it something descriptive.  My folder here is called ProjectName.
                          That's not very descriptive so choose a better name depending on what project you're working on.

                      That's all there is to it.  Now you can start adding your files and place them into the appropriate directories.
                      If you want to add a C++ file, for example, then save the
                      file into the source folder, then add it to your folder view in the Programmer's Notepad as well similar to how you added the Makefile.

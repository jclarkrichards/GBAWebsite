                      In order to start any of the projects on this site, you'll first need to create an empty project.  The process can be kind of confusing,
                      so refer to this page anytime you need to start a new project and you'll be fine.

              <h1>Folders</h1>
              <div class="imageflex">

                  <img src="images/folders.png" alt="" />
                  <div class="middle">
                      <p>
                          The first thing you want to do is create your project folder structure.  It's actually not that complicated, just pick a location on your
                          computer where you want to store the project.  Create a new folder and name it something descriptive.  My folder here is called ProjectName.
                          That's not very descriptive so choose a better name depending on what project you're working on.
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                          Go into the folder you just created and create 2 more folders called 'include' and 'source'.  The source folder will hold all of our C++ (.cpp) files
                          and the include folder will hold all of our header (.h) files.
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                          You also want to include the Makefile which can be found in your devkitpro folder structure at devkitpro/examples/gba/template folder.
                          Just copy that Makefile into your project folder.
                      </p>




                  </div>
                  <div class="sideInfo">
                      <p>
                          If, for some reason, you don't see the Makefile in your devkitpro, then you can just download it directly from github.  The link below will
                          take you there.

                      <p>Once that is done we can open up the Programmer's Notepad and create a new project.  You do that by clicking File > New > Project.  </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="sideInfo">

                  <div class="middle">
                      <p>A smaller window will pop up asking to provide the path to the project.  Give it a name and then link to the project folder we just created.</p>

                      <p>
                          The last thing you want to do now is recreate that folder structure within the Programmer's Notepad so you stay organized.  To do that right-click
                          on the project name in the projects window and recreated the 2 folders "source" and "include" and then add the Makefile.
                      </p>

              <h1>Conclusion</h1>

                  <p>That's all there is to it.  Now you can start adding your files and place them into the appropriate directories.  </p>

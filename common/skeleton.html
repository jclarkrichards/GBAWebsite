                      In order to start any of the projects on this site, you'll first need to create an empty project.  The process can be kind of confusing,
                      so refer to this page anytime you need to start a new project and you'll be fine.

              <h1>Folders</h1>
              <div class="imageflex">

                  <img src="images/folders.png" alt="" />
                  <div class="middle">
                      <p>
                          The first thing you want to do is create your project folder structure.  It's actually not that complicated, just pick a location on your
                          computer where you want to store the project.  Create a new folder and name it something descriptive.  My folder here is called ProjectName.
                          That's not very descriptive so choose a better name depending on what project you're working on.  Just don't put any spaces in your project or file names.
                          You can use underscores and dashes though.
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                          Go into the folder you just created and create 2 more folders called 'include' and 'source'.  The source folder will hold all of our C++ (.cpp) files
                          and the include folder will hold all of our header (.h) files.
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                          You also want to include the Makefile which can be found in your devkitpro folder structure at devkitpro/examples/gba/template folder.
                          Just copy that Makefile into your project folder.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          Your project should look similar to what you see on the left.  
                      </p>

                      <br />
                      <p>
                          If, for some reason, you don't see the Makefile in your devkitpro, then you can just download it directly from github.  The link below will
                          take you there.

              <h1>Add Makefile</h1>
              <div class="imageflex">

                  <div class="middle">
                      <p>
                          The last thing you want to do now is recreate that folder structure within the Programmer's Notepad so you stay organized.  To do that right-click
                          on the project name in the projects window and recreate the 2 folders "source" and "include" and then add the Makefile.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          When you create your .cpp and .h files you'll place them in the source and include folders respectively as per norm.  Once you do that you can also right-click
                          the folders in the projects section and add them in there as well so you always have a visual of your folder structure.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          This isn't necessary for the program to compile or anything, but it is a good idea to mimick your project folder structure on the side there.  It will
                          make things easier especially when you start writing programs that require many many files.  So I would suggest to get into the habit now.

              <h1>Conclusion</h1>
              <div class="conclusion">

                  <p>That's all there is to it.  Now you can start adding your files and place them into the appropriate directories.  
                  If you want to add a C++ file, for example, then save the 
                  file into the source folder, then add it to your folder view in the Programmer's Notepad as well similar to how you added the Makefile.</p>

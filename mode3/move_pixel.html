                        This tutorial can be better appreciated if you've already followed the previous tutorial where we drew a single red pixel to the upper left corner
                        of the screen.  In this tutorial we'll basically do the same thing, but we'll draw the pixel a different color and place it somewhere else on the screen.
                        We will also clean the code up a bit and show you some techniques to make it more readable.

                            If you haven't already open up the Programmer's Notepad or whatever editor you're using and create a new empty project.
                            This will usually be the first task in all of our projects, so that's why I've created a page that explains how to create an empty project and get it ready for our code.
                            If you need help setting the project up, look at the sidebar on the right.

                            As always, copy this code and then compile and run it.  Once this is working without errors continue.  You can make the pixel any color and

                            So the first thing we need to do is add the key register which is at memory address 0x0400:0130.  Remember to set it as a volatile 2 byte.  Next we're going to 
                            define the keys RIGHT, LEFT, UP, and DOWN.  Simply the directions we want the pixel to move in.  Inside of the main function we'll define the current state and previous
                            state with curr and prev respectively.  They both have to be the same size as the register which is a volatile unsigned short.  We then initially set them to be
                            the inverse of the register.  The reason we do that can be found on the page where we talk about the keys.  The link is above.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now we're actually going to put something in the while loop instead of having it empty all the time.  We're simply going to check if any of the four keys we
                            defined are being held down.  If so, then we move the pixel in that direction.  We move the pixel by incrementing or decrementing its x and y values then 
                            drawing that pixel in the new location.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finally, we update the curr and prev variables so that we pass the current state to the prev variable and then get a new current state for the curr variable.

                            Go ahead and run the program now and press the directional keys on your keyboard.  What happens?  The pixel definitely moves, but not how you would expect.  
                            Pressing right for just a moment colors half the screen the same color as the pixel for instance.  That's not really what we wanted to do.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The reason this does this is because the pixel is just moving way too fast.  The code is being called too often.  We need to slow the pixel down somehow.  The issue 
                            actually brings up another seemingly unrelated issue.  When is it a good time to update the pixel's position?  If your response was "as soon as possible my good man!", 
                            then you are wrong!  Think about it for a second.  Remember in the <a href="../common/basics.html" class="inline_btn">Basics</a> section where we talked about
                            the scanlines and the vertical and horizontal blanks?  If not, then go ahead and review that section.  Then once you're done with that read the section linked here
                            which talks about vsyncing which is what we need in order to fix our problem.

                            Go ahead and run the code again. You should see a pixel in the middle of the screen.  Using your keypad you can move this pixel around in 4 directions.  What you may also
                            notice is that it leaves a trail behind.  Hey, we just made an Etch-A-Sketch!  Well sort of, same idea.  I'm sure you can have fun with this, and this is what we'll start
                            with when we actually do the Etch-A-Sketch project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The reason it leaves a trail is because when we move the pixel around we're adding the color information of the pixel into VRAM.  As long as that color information remains
                            in VRAM then the pixel that corresponds to that VRAM address is going to display that color.  So if you don't want to leave a trail, then anytime you move you would also 
                            have to clear the VRAM address you were just at.  You can do that very easily by just setting your the color to (0, 0, 0), which is black, in VRAM before incrementing or
                            decrementing the x and y variables.  I won't display that here, but try it out for extra credit.

                        The code looks a lot better now.  Go ahead and play around with it.  Set new values for x and y.  Change the color of the pixel to something else instead of red.
                        What does the value (12, 30, 5) look like?  A blue pixel would look like (0, 0, 31).  You can even draw more than 1 pixel onto the screen, so go ahead and do that.
                        Playing around and trying things is one of the best ways to learn something.  In the next tutorial we're going to do something interesting.  We are going to draw
                        thousands of pixels of random colors onto random locations.

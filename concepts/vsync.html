                        The GBA is constantly scanning the screen from left to right and
                        top to bottom drawing any pixel that needs to be drawn (whether it is in VRAM or not).  Let's say you have some object on the screen that you're moving around and
                        so you tell it to move by pressing one of the keys.  If that happens while the scanlines are being drawn, then there's a chance that maybe only half of your
                        character was drawn when you issued the command.  Issuing the command moves your character automatically, so when the scanlines continue drawing your character
                        the second have of your character will have moved while the top half stayed in place because they were already drawn.  This is called screen-tearing and is very
                        undesirable.  The best way to avoid it is to only update positions when the screen is not being drawn.  Remember the screen isn't being drawn only during HBLANK and
                        VBLANK.  VBLANK gives us the most time to update the state of our characters.  Well, how much time do we have until VBLANK is over and the screen starts to draw
                        again?  That's a good question so let's figure it out.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The moral of the story is that we need to be able to determine when the VBLANK starts so that we can have the maximum amount of time to update everything we can.
                        That way we can also guarantee that we only update objects once per frame instead of 100 times or some other random number per frame.

                            The VCOUNT register is a register whose sole purpose is to keep track which line is currently being scanned.  So it is a fairly simple register.  Like all of the other
                            registers, it is a 2 byte register even though it only uses 1 byte.  So when the scanline is on line 0, the value of this register will be 0.  If the scanline is on line 143,
                            the value of this register is 143.  This is a read-only register as there is no reason to write to it.  We'll just read from it and see what scanline we are currently on.

                            Now that we know about the VCOUNT register, we can use it in order to keep track of when VCOUNT starts.  We know that the VCOUNT starts on line 160 
                            because that's the height of the screen.  So you may think that all we have to do is wait until we read a value that is greater than or equal to 160 before we can run the rest of
                            the game loop code.  That's partially correct.  The thing is we would never know for sure just how far inside the VBLANK we're in.  When that check executes we could be on line
                            200 or on line 230 or on any other line greater than or equal to 160.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So in the main while loop we have 2 more while loops.  The first loop checks to see if we are inside a VBLANK.  If we are inside a VBLANK (again, it can be anywhere in the
                            VBLANK), we hold and wait until we are out of the VBLANK before moving on to the second while loop.  Now once we reach the second while loop we'll be at the top of the screen
                            on scanline 0, so we hold here until we reach the start of the VBLANK again.  After the second while loop we can run any code we want that does whatever our game does.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This essentially guarantees that your code is only run once per frame and that you have the full VBLANK to do whatever you need to do and avoid screen tearing. 
                        </p>
